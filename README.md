# gunmetal.el -- dto's semantic color environment

I saw a screen capture of this theme on reddit and wanted to be sure I had a copy. This is the Emacs Lisp code that someone else found using archive.org. This is just a mirror/backup for reference. I don't even know if it works with Emacs 28+.

## AUTHORSHIP, LICENSING, AND COPYRIGHT

David O'Toole wrote it, I just copied it. He released it under the terms of the GPL v2 "or (at your option) any later version." I've marked this repository with the GNU General Public License V3.

This is just a mirror copy. I've done nothing but some administrivia and claim no rights, O'Toole's rights apply.
